# How to Update Your Local Script

## The Problem
You're running an old version of the script locally that still navigates to the Lindy homepage and looks for a menu. The updated version has been pushed to GitHub but you need to pull it to your local machine.

## Solution: Pull the Latest Changes

### Option 1: If you're in the project directory
```bash
cd /path/to/your/lindy-automation-selenium
git pull origin main
```

### Option 2: If you need to clone fresh
```bash
# Remove old directory if it exists
rm -rf lindy-automation-selenium

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Halfpro6119/lindy-automation-selenium.git

# Navigate to the directory
cd lindy-automation-selenium
```

### Option 3: Download the file directly from GitHub
If you don't want to use git, you can download the updated file directly:

1. Go to: https://github.com/Halfpro6119/lindy-automation-selenium/blob/main/main_playwright.py
2. Click the "Raw" button
3. Save the file and replace your local `main_playwright.py`

## Verify the Update
After updating, check that the delete_account function starts with:

```python
async def delete_account(self):
    """Delete Lindy account"""
    print("\n" + "="*70)
    print("DELETING ACCOUNT")
    print("="*70)
    
    try:
        # Navigate directly to settings page
        print("\n→ Navigating to settings page...")
        await self.page.goto("https://chat.lindy.ai/rileys-workspace-5/settings/general", wait_until='networkidle', timeout=60000)
        await self.page.wait_for_timeout(5000)
```

You should NOT see any code about navigating to the Lindy homepage or looking for a menu button.

## Run the Updated Script
```bash
python main_playwright.py
```

The output should now show:
```
→ Navigating to settings page...
✓ Navigated to settings page
→ Looking for Delete Account button...
```

Instead of:
```
→ Navigating to Lindy...
→ Looking for menu button...
```
