# Quick Reference: Google Authentication for Lindy Automation

## TL;DR - How to Use

### First Time Setup
```bash
# Run with visible browser
python main_playwright_headed.py

# Log in manually when prompted
# Session is saved automatically
```

### All Subsequent Runs
```bash
# Runs automatically without login
python main_playwright.py
```

That's it! Your session lasts for weeks/months.

## Three Authentication Methods Available

### Method 1: Session Storage (CURRENT - EASIEST) ‚úÖ
**File:** `main_playwright.py` or `main_playwright_headed.py`

**How it works:**
- First run: Manual login required
- Saves session to `lindy_session.json`
- Future runs: Automatic

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Already implemented
- ‚úÖ No setup required
- ‚úÖ Most reliable

**Reset session:**
```bash
rm lindy_session.json
```

---

### Method 2: Browser Profile (ENHANCED) ‚úÖ
**File:** `main_playwright_profile.py`

**How it works:**
- Uses persistent browser profile (like Chrome user profile)
- Saves ALL browser data (cookies, cache, local storage)
- More persistent than session files

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Longer session persistence
- ‚úÖ Better mimics real user
- ‚úÖ Can save multiple profiles

**Usage:**
```bash
python main_playwright_profile.py
```

**Reset profile:**
```bash
rm -rf browser_profile/
```

---

### Method 3: Google OAuth API (ADVANCED) ‚ö†Ô∏è
**File:** `google_oauth_helper.py` (create if needed)

**How it works:**
- Uses Google Cloud OAuth 2.0
- Programmatic token generation
- Requires Google Cloud setup

**Pros:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è More control over tokens
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Can refresh automatically

**Cons:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Complex setup required
- ‚ö†Ô∏è May not work with Lindy's auth
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires Google Cloud project

**Not recommended unless you have specific requirements**

## Common Questions

### Q: Can I completely automate Google login without any manual steps?
**A:** No. Google actively blocks automated logins to protect accounts. The best approach is:
1. Log in manually once
2. Save the session
3. All future runs are automatic

### Q: How long does the session last?
**A:** 
- Session Storage: 2-4 weeks typically
- Browser Profile: 1-3 months typically
- Depends on Google's security policies

### Q: What if my session expires?
**A:** The script will detect this and prompt you to log in again manually. Just run the headed version:
```bash
python main_playwright_headed.py
```

### Q: Can I use multiple Google accounts?
**A:** Yes! Save different session files:
```python
# In your script
session_file = f"lindy_session_{account_name}.json"
```

### Q: Is it safe to save my session?
**A:** Yes, but:
- ‚úÖ Keep session files secure
- ‚úÖ Don't commit to Git (already in .gitignore)
- ‚úÖ Delete when done: `rm lindy_session.json`

### Q: Why can't I just use username/password in the script?
**A:** Google will:
- Show CAPTCHA challenges
- Flag as "unusual activity"
- Potentially lock your account
- Violate Terms of Service

## Troubleshooting

### Session Expired
```bash
rm lindy_session.json
python main_playwright_headed.py
```

### "Unusual Activity" Warning
- Use browser profile method
- Add delays between runs
- Don't run too frequently

### CAPTCHA Challenges
- Use saved sessions (avoid repeated logins)
- Use browser profiles
- Run less frequently

### Account Locked
- Verify account manually
- Wait 24 hours
- Use less aggressive automation

## Security Checklist

- [ ] Never commit `config.py`
- [ ] Never commit `lindy_session.json`
- [ ] Never commit `browser_profile/`
- [ ] Use `.env` for credentials (optional)
- [ ] Delete session files when done
- [ ] Monitor Google security alerts
- [ ] Use app-specific passwords if using 2FA

---

## Recommended Workflow

**For Development/Testing:**
```bash
# Use visible browser to see what's happening
python main_playwright_headed.py
```

**For Production/Automation:**
```bash
# Use headless mode for efficiency
python main_playwright.py
```

**For Maximum Persistence:**
```bash
# Use browser profile version
python main_playwright_profile.py
```
