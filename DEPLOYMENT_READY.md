## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Can't access Settings page?
- You need admin/owner access to the repository
- Ask the repository owner (Halfpro6119) to add the secret
- Or fork the repository to your own account

### Cookies not working?
- Re-extract cookies by signing into Gmail again
- Make sure you copied the ENTIRE base64 string
- Check that the secret name is exactly `GOOGLE_COOKIES`

### Workflow not running?
- Check GitHub Actions is enabled in repository settings
- Verify the workflow file is in `.github/workflows/` directory
- Check the Actions tab for error messages

## 🎯 Cookie Lifespan

Your cookies will last approximately **2 years** (until October 2027).

When they expire, simply:
1. Sign into Gmail again in the browser
2. Re-run the cookie extraction
3. Update the `GOOGLE_COOKIES` secret in GitHub

---

## 💡 Tips

- **Test locally first**: Run `python3 main_playwright_cookies.py` to test
- **Check logs**: GitHub Actions logs show detailed execution info
- **Download artifacts**: Screenshots and logs are saved for 7 days
- **Customize schedule**: Edit the cron expression in the workflow file
