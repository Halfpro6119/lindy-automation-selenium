## ‚öôÔ∏è Customization Options

### Make it Run Slower (Easier to Watch)

Edit `main_playwright.py` and change this line:

```python
self.browser = await playwright.chromium.launch(
    headless=False,
    slow_mo=1000  # Add this line - 1000ms = 1 second between actions
)
```

### Change Wait Times

Edit `config.py`:

```python
SHORT_WAIT = 5      # Change to 10 for slower
MEDIUM_WAIT = 10    # Change to 20 for slower
WAIT_TIME = 600     # Change to 60 for 1 minute instead of 10
```

### Skip Account Deletion

In `main_playwright.py`, comment out this line in the `run()` method:

```python
# await self.delete_lindy_account()  # Add # at the start
```

### Pause at Specific Steps

Add this line anywhere in `main_playwright.py` to pause:

```python
await self.page.pause()  # Browser will pause and wait for you to click "Resume"
```

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "python: command not found"

Try `python3` instead:
```bash
python3 main_playwright.py
```

### "playwright: command not found"

Install it:
```bash
pip install playwright
python -m playwright install chromium
```

### "Module not found: playwright"

Make sure you're in the right directory:
```bash
cd lindy-automation-selenium
pip install playwright pyperclip
```

### Browser doesn't open (runs in background)

Make sure you're using `main_playwright.py` (not `main.py`). The Playwright version has `headless=False` which makes the browser visible.

### Google blocks sign-in

- Try using an app-specific password
- Disable 2FA temporarily
- Google may require manual verification first time

### "Permission denied" on Mac/Linux

Use `pip3` and `python3`:
```bash
pip3 install playwright pyperclip
python3 -m playwright install chromium
python3 main_playwright.py
```

## üìä Comparison: Playwright vs Selenium

| Feature | Playwright (main_playwright.py) | Selenium (main.py) |
|---------|--------------------------------|-------------------|
| **Visibility** | ‚úÖ Excellent | ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires config |
| **Setup** | ‚úÖ Easy (auto-installs) | ‚ö†Ô∏è Need ChromeDriver |
| **Speed** | ‚úÖ Faster | ‚ö†Ô∏è Slower |
| **Reliability** | ‚úÖ More stable | ‚ö†Ô∏è Can be flaky |
| **Debugging** | ‚úÖ Better tools | ‚ö†Ô∏è Standard |

**Recommendation:** Use `main_playwright.py` for the best experience! ‚≠ê

## üé¨ Recording the Automation

### Built-in Playwright Inspector

```bash
PWDEBUG=1 python main_playwright.py
```

This opens a debugger where you can step through each action!

### Screen Recording

**Mac:**
- Use QuickTime Player ‚Üí File ‚Üí New Screen Recording

**Windows:**
- Press `Win + G` to open Game Bar
- Click record button

**Linux:**
```bash
sudo apt-get install recordmydesktop
recordmydesktop &
python3 main_playwright.py
```

## üîí Security Tips

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:**

1. **Never commit `config.py`** to GitHub (it's already in `.gitignore`)
2. **Use app-specific passwords** instead of your main Google password
3. **Don't share your config file** with anyone
4. **Delete test accounts** after use
5. **Use test credit cards** when possible

## üìù Summary

**To run with visible browser:**

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/Halfpro6119/lindy-automation-selenium.git
cd lindy-automation-selenium

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Run in slow motion** for easier viewing (add `slow_mo=1000`)
2. **Use dual monitors** - code on one, browser on the other
3. **Record the session** for later review
4. **Pause at key steps** using `await self.page.pause()`
5. **Check console output** for detailed logs

---

## üÜò Need Help?

If you run into issues:

1. Check the console output for error messages
2. Make sure all dependencies are installed
3. Verify credentials in `config.py`
4. Try increasing wait times
5. Open an issue on GitHub with error details
